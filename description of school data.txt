DATASETS Linked list formats of friendship choices made by students from 84 communities. Each community contains either 1 or two junior high or high schools. The numbers of students in each community vary. Those numbers range from 25 to 2587. In each case the data include friendship choices and various individual characteristics.

DESCRIPTION

The ADD HEALTH data are constructed from the in-school questionnaire; 90,118 students representing 84 communities took this survey in 1994-95. Some communities had only one school; others had two. Where there are two schools in a community students from one school were allowed to name friends in the other, the "sister school."

Each student was given a paper-and-pencil questionnaire and a copy of a roster listing every student in the school and, if the community had two schools, the student s provided with the roster of the "sister" school. The name generator asked about five male and five female friends separately. The question was, "List your closest (male/female) friends. List your best (male/female) friend first, then your next best friend, and so on. (girls/boys) may include (boys/girls) who are friends and (boy/girl) friends."
For each friend named, the student was asked to check off whether he/she participated in any of five activities with the friend. These activities were:

1. you went to (his/her) house in the last seven days.
2. you met (him/her) after school to hang out or go somewhere in the last seven days.
3. you spent time with (him/her) last weekend.
4. you talked with (him/her) about a problem in the last seven days.
5. you talked with (him/her) on the telephone in the last seven days.

These activities were summed to create a valued network. Ties range in value from 1, meaning the student nominated the friend but reported no activities, to 6, meaning the student nominated the friend and reported participating in all five activities with the friend.

Because nominations to friends in the sister school were allowed, the networks here are reported at the community level. When two schools were present in a community the data file includes a node-level indicator for school code, so one can easily extract choices from the separate schools.

The friendship choices are recorded in the COMM files. And the COMM_ATT files include the sex, race, grade in school and, in communities that have two schools, the school code.

Sex is coded 1=male, 2=female, 0=unreported. Race is coded 1=white, 2=black, 3=hispanic, 4=asian, 5=mixed/other, 0=unreported. Grade is recorded as a number between 7 and 12 with 0=unreported. And school codes are 0 and 1 when two schools were in a single community.
